# This is Homework-5

It is a command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and allows calculations both with and without multiprocessing for improved performance. Key features include an interactive REPL mode, error handling for invalid inputs, a plugin system for extensibility, and command-line argument support. This Homework is designed to enhance efficiency, particularly when running multiple calculations, by using separate processes through multiprocessing.
